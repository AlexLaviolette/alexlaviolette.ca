				<p>
					I (he/him) am a <span class='pop'>senior software engineer</span> with a focus on scalable distributed systems and backend APIs. I have extensive experience architecting and building security-conscious high-throughput services.
				</p>
				<p>
					In my spare time I like to build things, be active, and play video games. I have a healthy obsession with snowboarding, disc golf, and hockey - I am an extremely dedicated and longtime Leaf fan because I clearly enjoy emotional damage.
